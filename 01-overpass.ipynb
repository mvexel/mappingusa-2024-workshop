    "## Welcome to the OSM data analsyis workshop!\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first part, we will work with some data from the *Overpass API*. Overpass lets you query data from OSM to suit a lot of needs, including ours. We use the convenient [Overpass Turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/#) interface, which includes some special tricks that make our lives easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the simplest query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "node(1);\n",
    "out;\n",
    "```\n",
    "[excute it here](https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1G7f)\n",
    "\n",
    "This simply fetches the the first node (point) ever in OpenStreetMap, the one with `id` of 1.\n",
    "(Fun fact: this node was not originally created at its current location, and it did not always represent a communications tower. Do not ever assume that objects in OSM are stable.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not very useful yet. Let's add a little flavor.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "node[shop]({{bbox}});\n",
    "out;\n",
    "```\n",
    "[execute it here](https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1G7j)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we're fetching all the nodes that represent shops within the current map view on Overpass Turbo. So, the results you get will depend on the map view.\n",
    "\n",
    "![overpass map view](images/overpass-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks nice, but the data is not useful for analysis in its current form. It's just dots on a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "A button in the top right of the Overpass Turbo interface lets you switch between a map view and a data view. Let's have a look:\n",
    "\n",
    "![overpass data view](images/overpass-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Better! But this data is still pretty hard to work with. What we like as aspiring data scientists is **columnar data**, think spreadsheets. Overpass will output CSV data if you tell it to in the first line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[out:csv(\"shop\",\"name\",::version,::timestamp,::lon,::lat)];\n",
    "node[shop]({{bbox}});\n",
    "out;\n",
    "```\n",
    "[execute it here](https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1G7l)\n",
    "\n",
    "![overpass csv output](images/overpass-3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not much, but we have some data we can work with! Let's move on to the next notebook.\n"
